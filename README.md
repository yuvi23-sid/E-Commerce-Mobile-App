# E-Commerce Product App

## Description

The **E-Commerce Product App** is a mobile application designed to showcase and manage products in an e-commerce environment. It allows users to search for products, view product details, and browse through different categories. With an easy-to-use interface, users can find products, see their prices, images, and descriptions, and interact with the app seamlessly.

### Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse through a list of products displayed in a clean, organized layout.
- **Product Search**: A search bar allows users to search for products by name or category.
- **Product Details**: Each product shows its title, price, image, and description.
- **Categories**: Products are organized by categories such as electronics, clothing, and more.
- **Featured Products**: A section displaying top products that may interest users.
- **Buy Now Section**: Although not fully functional for purchasing, the "Buy Now" section lets users explore the product selection.

### API and Database

Initially, the app was designed to use the **BestBuy API** to fetch product data. However, due to privacy concerns and the need for a corporate email to obtain the API key, we encountered difficulties with BestBuy's API Key. As a result, we switched to the **FakeStore API**, which provides an open, free alternative to retrieve product data. 

The **FakeStore API** provides:
- A wide selection of products across various categories.
- Information about each product, including its title, price, image, and category.
- A reliable solution for our needs while we resolve issues with the BestBuy API.
